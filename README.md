Hi! This is a program I made to explore Fourier Transform/ Fraunhofer Diffraction. 
Still a WIP, but there's a preview here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8ou-9nwxbY

If you want to just run it, download the zip and extract, and double click the .exe. Make sure all the unzipped files are in the same folder!

Made in Godot .NET 4.2
